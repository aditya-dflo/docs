title: 'Voice Call Optimization'
description: 'Follow these best practices to optimize voice calls built with Dialflo for better performance, higher pickup rates, and a more natural user experience.'
---

## Assistant Configuration

* **Choose the right voice**: Select a voice that aligns with your brand personality and target audience. Test different voices to identify what feels most natural to users.
* **Craft clear prompts**: Use concise and natural-sounding prompts that clearly guide the conversation and reduce confusion.
* **Use personalization where possible**: Incorporate contextual details such as names or transaction information to make conversations feel more relevant.
* **Set an appropriate speaking pace**: A moderate voice speed improves clarity and keeps conversations comfortable to follow.

## Call Quality

* **Optimize caller numbers**: Use phone numbers that are familiar and trustworthy to your target audience to improve pickup rates.
* **Time calls thoughtfully**: Schedule calls during business hours or times when recipients are most likely to be available.
* **Limit retry attempts**: Configure a small number of retries for unanswered calls to avoid appearing intrusive.
* **Monitor call outcomes**: Review call duration, completion rates, and feedback to identify patterns and areas for improvement.

## Content Strategy

* **Keep introductions brief**: Clearly state who the caller is and the purpose of the call within the first few seconds.
* **Use conversational language**: Write scripts that sound natural and avoid overly formal or robotic phrasing.
* **Prepare for common responses**: Anticipate likely user replies and define clear paths for each scenario.
* **End with a clear next step**: Conclude calls with specific actions or instructions so users know what to do next.

## Technical Considerations

* **Test across networks**: Validate call performance on different networks and connection qualities to ensure consistency.
* **Monitor response latency**: Keep response times low to maintain a natural conversational flow.
* **Handle unexpected input gracefully**: Design fallback responses for cases where users say something unanticipated.
* **Scale concurrency gradually**: For bulk calling campaigns, start with a smaller number of concurrent calls and increase based on observed performance.
