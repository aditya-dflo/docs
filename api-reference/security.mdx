description: 'Follow these security best practices to protect your Dialflo integration, systems, and user data when deploying AI-powered voice workflows.'
---

## API Key Management

* **Secure storage**: Never expose API keys in client-side code, public repositories, or browser-accessible files.
* **Environment variables**: Store API keys in environment variables or secure configuration systems on the server.
* **Access control**: Restrict API key usage to only trusted services and team members.
* **Key rotation**: Rotate API keys periodically and immediately if a compromise is suspected.
* **Usage monitoring**: Monitor API usage patterns to detect unexpected spikes or abnormal behavior.

---

## Data Protection

* **Minimize data collection**: Collect and transmit only the data required for the voice interaction to function.
* **Secure transmission**: Always use HTTPS for all API requests and webhook communications.
* **Data retention**: Define and enforce clear retention policies for call data, recordings, and transcripts.
* **User consent**: Inform users when calls may be recorded or analyzed and obtain appropriate consent.
* **PII handling**: Handle personally identifiable information with care and limit access to authorized systems only.

---

## Web Integration Security

* **Content Security Policy**: Configure CSP rules to allow only required scripts, media, and network connections.
* **Domain configuration**: Ensure that only authorized domains are used for embedding Web Call experiences.
* **XSS protection**: Sanitize and validate all dynamic inputs to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
* **Iframe safeguards**: If embedding via iframe, apply appropriate sandbox and permission attributes.
* **CORS configuration**: Limit cross-origin requests to only trusted origins.

---

## Authentication and Access Control

* **Least privilege principle**: Grant only the minimum access required for users and systems.
* **Regular access reviews**: Periodically audit who has access to Dialflo-related credentials and systems.
* **Strong credentials**: Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts interacting with Dialflo services.
* **Session management**: Implement appropriate session timeouts and token invalidation mechanisms.

---

## Compliance and Transparency

* **Privacy regulations**: Ensure your implementation complies with applicable data protection laws and regulations.
* **User disclosure**: Clearly inform users that they are interacting with an AI-powered voice assistant.
* **Opt-out options**: Provide users with a clear way to opt out of AI-driven calls or interactions where applicable.
* **Internal documentation**: Maintain documentation of your security controls and operational practices.
